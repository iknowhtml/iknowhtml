# Hey there, I'm Aki ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my Github profile!
I'm currently build stuff in blockchain & web3 at [Ava Labs](https://www.avalabs.org/), was a co-founder and lead engineer at [Coral](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coral-fan/about/), and previously helped make the web more accessible at [User1st](https://www.user1st.com/). 

When I'm not making another unnecessary refactor in my code or catching up on the latest flavor of the month in the JS ecosystem, I'm lifting heavy stuff at the gym, making pourovers and spending way too much money on clothes.

Check out my projects below.
